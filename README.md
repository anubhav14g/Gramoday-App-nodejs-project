# Gramoday App (Nodejs Project)

# About  
Every day prices of agriculture commodities change across different mandis/markets in the country. On Gramoday App, daily prices are reported by users whose occupation is mandi commission agent. Each mandi commission agent maps to one market commodity combination for which he creates a daily price report.
Prices can be reported across multiple units like Kg, Quintal, Bag, etc. with each unit having a conversion factor in terms of base unit (kg).
One market commodity combination can have a daily price report contributed by 2 users, in which case, an aggregate (average of values) report needs to be created which is available for consumption on the platform.
